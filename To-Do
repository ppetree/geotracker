Here are the current to-do's:

1) some field descriptions are tied to joomla core labels that no longer exist and these need updating
2) google maps javascript makes a deprecated call that needs to be rewritten. (tmpl/default.php)
3) MAYBE add in some more free geoip services
4) Determine how to get the update service working without using one of my servers.
