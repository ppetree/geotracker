Here are the current to-do's:

1) update sql code to use full joomla framework incase we get bad data back from the geo services
2) some field descriptions are tied to joomla core labels that no longer exist and these need updating
3) google maps javascript makes a deprecated call that needs to be rewritten. (tmpl/default.php)
4) MAYBE add in some more free geoip services
5) Add labels to the pins showing date of visit and how many visits (total site page views)
